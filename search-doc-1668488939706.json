Click on the \"read\" command to read the current IP value. AT+GATEWAY It is used to define gateway to devices with Ethernet or Wi-Fi capability. In a local network, the gateway is usually the IP address of the modem.  AT + GATEWAY \"command to read and write the gateway address. AT+NETMASK It is used to define \"netmask\" for devices with Ethernet or Wi-Fi capability.  AT+DHCP AT+DHCP= Enable/Disable DHCP. • AT+DHCP = 0 – Disable • AT+DHCP= 1 – Enable AT+LWIPTMO If no packets received from PLC Ethernet port, resets the Ethernet connection.  AT+CONFIGPORT  The AT + CONFIGPORT command is used to identify the port number used in situations where a TCP port connection from Mikrodiagram is desired to be installed on devices with a TCP communication port (Ethernet, GSM, Wi-Fi). The factory default ConfigPort number is 502. It can be changed with AT + CONFIGPORT command. AT + CONFIGPORT = ? command can be viewed with the current configport.  CONFIGPORT is disabled when a selected TCP socket block is added to the device as a server Mikrodiagram. The device's listening port is the listening port that is inserted into the TCP socket block. AT+MAC It is used to define the MAC address for devices with Ethernet or Wi-Fi capability.  The current MAC address can be read with \"read\" command. GSM​ AT+GPRSAPN AT + GPRSAPN command is used to define APN for Mikrodev products with GSM TCP communication feature. Since the APN that needs to be defined varies according to the SIM card operator used in the device,it must be supplied from the customer service of the relevant GSM operator. The APN has to be defined if the used device is to be used as a server in the TCP communication with the GSM line (if the device will connect to another IP). Note: The SIM card used in the APN-defined device must have a static IP. Note: GPRSAPN Settings for Turkcell - mgbsfor Vodafone - internetstatikfor Türk Telekom - statikip  AT+SIM It is used for SIM card inquiry in Mikrodev products with GSM hardware. With \"AT + SIM =?\" read only command. The value can not be written. The response to the command is SIM = 0 to indicate that the SIM card is not inserted, is incorrectly installed or is defective. If the answer to the command is SIM = 1, it indicates that the SIM card is correctly installed and is fault-free. AT+CSQ It is the value of the GSM signal quality (the power of the GSM line) that the devices with GSM capability are installed. It can be between 0 and 31. Even if the SIM card is not inserted, the value can be read while the GSM antenna is connected. (Emergency calls are used on mobile phones when the SIM card is not inserted.) AT + CSQ is only readable command. The pull chart is as follows.   AT+IMEI It is used to find out the IMEI number of the SIM Card. AT+GPRSIP The data package (internet package) is the IP of the SIM card. Supplied by the GSM operator. It can only be read by AT + GPRSIP command. If the device is to be used as a server, a SIM card with a fixed IP address must be provided. When a SIM card with a fixed IP is provided, APN information must also be received from the GSM operator.  Socket Status​ AT+SERVERTIMEOUT If the connection between the device and the remote system is lost or the connection between the devices is lost, it is waited for the specified second and then used to reset the device.  AT+SOCKET It is used to monitor the active connections of TCP socket blocks in Mikrodiagram project. When AT + SOCKET = <\"TCP Socket Block\" Block Number> command is sent to the device, the connections made from the relevant TCP socket block are displayed. Those with status \"1\" indicate that the connection exists. The \"status\" states, which are different from \"1\", indicate that the link already existed, but that the link broke down before the specified time.   AT+PLCRESET  The AT + PLCRESET command is used when TCP communication protocols require the device to be reset after a certain period of time. If AT + PLCRESET = 0 command is sent to the device, the command is disabled. The AT + PLCRESET command runs at a minimum 60 second (sec) scale. To learn the current PLCRESET command programmed in the device, enter AT + PLCRESET =? command can be sent to the device. AT+CONNECTION Connection status check of Mikrodev products with GSM data exchange feature is done by \"AT + CONNECTION\" command.  The AT + CONNECTION command has only readability. The AT + CONNECTION command receives even-numbered values 0-8. The AT + CONNECTION command response table is below.     PLC Status​ AT+HELP It is the command that indicates which queries can be asked to the device.  AT+INCLUDE It is the command that shows which features are active or inactive on the device.  AT+VERSION It is the command that shows the version information on the device.  AT+POWERCOUNT It shows how many times the device is restarted after Mikrodiagram project is loaded. The first value is 1 since the device is restarted after the mikrordiagram project has been loaded. Readable command. AT + POWERCOUNT= ? , The current value is queried.  AT+ERROR If the device is in error mode, it is used to learn the error code.  If AT + ERROR = 0, then there is no error condition. AT + ERROR = 61 means that the device does not have Mikrodiagram installed The AT + ERROR command is only a readable command.  PLC Time​ AT+SETTIME With the AT + SETTIME command, the device real time clock can be read and written.  When the AT + SETTIME command \"read\" is clicked, the current time of the device readable in the console window, the date and time to be set to the command window; When set to \"dd-mm-yyyy hⓂ️s\" and the \"summer\" command is sent, the time set is displayed in the console window.  PLC LCD​ AT+MENULINE1AT+MENULINE2   WIFI Settings​ AT+WIFISSID It is used to identify the WI-FI network name to be included in WI-FI enabled products. In the \"AT + WIFISSID\" command window, the WI-FI name is written, the \"write\" command is clicked, When you want to read the current WI-FI SSID, click \"AT + WIFISSID\" \"read\" command. AT+WIFIPSSW It is used to describe the password of the WI-FI network to be included in WI-FI-enabled products. AT + WIFIPSSW WI-FI password is written into the command window, click on the \"write\" command, When the current WI-FI password is desired to be read, the AT + WIFIPSSW \"read\" command is clicked. CANBUS​ AT+CANSTATUS It is state learning command for Mikrodev Expansion Devices.  AT+CANCOMMAND With the AT+CANCOMMAND query, information about the expansion device can be accessed. AT+CANCOMMAND=< BoardType >,< BoardId >,< Channel >,< Command >,< VALUE > • BoardType: XIO211_DIN = 0,XIO211_DOUT = 1,XIO211_RELAY = 2,XIO211_AIN = 3,XIO211_AOUT = 4,XIO211_RTD = 5,XIO211_DI8DQ8= 6,XIO211_DI8= 7,XIO211_DQ8= 8,XIO211_AI4AQ4= 9, • BoardID: Board value set with DIP Switch. • Channel: The corresponding channel number in the expansion. For example, if it will calibrate the 3rd input on the analog input, 2 will be written here. • Read Commands:  • Write Commands:   AT+CANTIMEOUT AT + CANTIMEOUT command Mikrodev is used to protect the position of the inputs and outputs on the expansion units for a specified period of time in case of communication failure between CPU modules and expansion units. The CANTIMEOUT time runs in millisecond (ms) time scale. When the communication link between the input modules and the CPU breaks, inputs up to the number of CANTIMEOUT entered into the CPU do not change position in the software. When the communication link between the output modules and the CPU breaks, the outputs do not change positions as long as the CANTIMEOUT times entered in the output modules. The CANTIMEOUT time input to the CPU is used for the input modules, the CANTIMEOUT time input to the output modules for the output modules is used. For example, if AT + CANTIMEOUT = 60000 (ms) is defined for the CPU and expansion units, the incoming digital input signal position is maintained through the expansion unit until 60000 (ms) (1 minute) after communication between the digital input (DI) expansion unit and the CPU is interrupted. 60000 ms. After the CANTIMEOUT time has elapsed, the digital inputs are pulled to logic (0) if no connection to the expansion unit is still present. Internal FS​ AT+FBD In Mikrodiagram, it is used to read block value and write block value by using \"block numbers\" of door types. If the value is to be written, \"AT + FBD = BLOKNO, VALUE\" is defined and clicked on the \"write\" command. If the block value is to be read, \"AT + FBD = BLOKNO,?\" is defined and clicked on the \"write\" command. The \"read\" command is not used in the AT + FBD command, only the \"write\" command is used. Example;   Since the 3000 no of block is a register block, both writing and reading can be done. When \"AT + FBD = 3000,10\" is entered and \"summer\" button is clicked, \"10\" value is written on block. Value information written is displayed as \"FBD = OK\" in the console window.  If you want to read the block value of no 3000 , \"AT + FBD = 3000,?\" is written and when the \"write\" command is clicked, the block value is displayed as \"FBD = 10\" in the console window. AT+ONLINE It is used to start and stop the online viewing from the mikroterminal while online viewing is performed in Mikrodiagram. Online monitoring is started when AT + ONLINE = 1 command is sent. Online monitoring is stopped when AT + ONLINE = 0 command is sent. AT+DEFAULT The AT+DEFAULT command is used to reset the unit to factory settings. While the device is counting 'autoboot', sending the AT+DEFAULT=1 command returns the device to its factory settings.  When the device is restored to factory settings, the settings made with the AT commands are restored to factory settings, the most recently loaded Mikrodiagram project is deleted from the device. After the command is sent, the device drops to error ERROR =61. The command AT+DEFAULT is only writable.  AT+PASSWORD •Add Password AT+PASSWORD= -1,\"PASSWORD\"  •Password Removal AT+PASSWORD= \"PASSWORD\",-1  AT+LOGIN AT+LOGIN=0 --- If the device has a password defined.  AT+LOGIN=1 --- If no password is defined on the device  AT+RESET The AT + RESET command is used for software restart of the device.  When AT + RESET = 1 is typed and the \"send\" button is clicked, the device is restarted. Other​ AT+ADCERROR ADC (Analog to Digital Converter). With this command the count of ADC errors is learned.  AT+FORMATFS The AT+FORMATFS =1 command is used to format Mikrodev products. While the device is counting \"autoboot\", sending the AT + FORMATFS = 1 command to the device will delete the firmware, so it is necessary to reload the firmware to program the device.

The content of the messages and phone numbers are stored in string registers of PLC device. And these strings are configured in PLC project on \"string tables\". Sometimes you may want to view and update the phone number for SMS messages through your SCADA system. The following example illustrates how you can achieve this. Storing the Phone Number​ Since industrial protocols like Modbus only supports numeric data types, you need to store a numeric version of your phone number. And since a single \"Long register\" is not enough for storing a phone number, this can be done by using \"2 Long Registers\". You can divide the phone number into 2 parts and write and read these numbers through these registers. But of course; you will also need to convert these \"2 Long Registers\" containing the phone number parts into a single \"String Register\". And copy that register into the \"phone number input\" of SMS block.  In the \"StringManipulation Block\" you need to select \"ToString\" function and write it into a string register, i.e \"index 2\".  Formatting the Phone Number​ In our example; we are using 10th and 11th String indexes as the format input of the phone number parts:  You should take care of these formats and actual phone number parts. They should be in accordance with each other. That means; If your phone number is like: +905556008899, your configuration will be something like that: Content of 10th string index: \"+90%04s\" Here\"%04s\" means prepend leading zeros up to 4 digits to your number.  Content of 11th string index: \"%06s\" Here\"%06s\" means prepend leading zeros up to 6 digits to your number.  So if your first long register contains \"5556\" and second long register contains \"8899\" these numbers will merged into \"+905556008899\" by using these formatting rules.  In the \"StringManipulation\" block below, you should select \"Append\" operation and copy the result into a string register i.e \"index 1\"  Running the Logic​ After configuring your \"phone number string\" mechanism, you just need to connect that string into the SMS block and write \"1\" into the \"trigger\" register.  View and Update on SCADA​ On the SCADA side; you can display \"2 Long Registers\" in two different components and an apply button for triggering the \"trigger\" register int the PLC project. The only drawback here is that the user should use the same number of characters as indicated in the format strings in PLC project. Download the sample PLC project from here non-pp firmware: There are 2 types of firmware , default one and the one with point to point networking stack for 3G connection. With point to point firmware you will have higher download/upload speed but no sms or call functionality.

The operating logic is based on data exchange between a master device and one or more devices connected to the master on the same network. It is often used to interconnect a controller computer with remote terminals. Data transfer is provided in the form of ones and zeros, that is, in bits. Although there are many versions, the most used versions are Modbus RTU and Modbus TCP/IP. This guide shows how Modbus TCP/IP and Modbus RTU communications are implemented on Mikrodev products. If our device is Mikrodev - PLC product, you can program it on Mikrodiagram program. If our device is Mikrodev RTU product, we use Telediagram program. So our programmers are customized to our products. The blocks used and their settings are the same in Telediagram and Microdiagram programs.

We use TSB block for our Master or Slave device to communicate with TCP/IP protocol. We can add function blocks from the Door Types window or by right-clicking in the project area. Figure 1: TSB Block And High Gate for Enable As you can see in Figure 1, we can set the IP and Port information from inside the TSB block, as well as from the outside using a register. To observe the connection status, we can put a flag or register on the Con output to observe its value. 0 means no connection, 1 means there is a connection. In function block settings, it is more practical to write non-variable values in the block. You can see the TSB block settings in Figure 2. Figure 2: TCP Socket Setting Figure 3: Media Type and Other Settings If our device is going to be Modbus Master by connecting our TSB Block to a Master block, we select the TCP client option from the Parameters;TCP Socket section (Figure 2) and enter the Server Port and Server IP of the Slave device to which we want to connect.;If our device is going to be Modbus Slave in communication by connecting our TSB Block to a Slave block, Parameters;TCP Socket setting (Figure 2) TCP Server is selected. TCP Server settings section will be active. Here, the TCP/IP port of our slave device is written. If we want, we can limit the devices to be connected to our device using the IP filter method by filling in the Server IP section. Supported and desired media type (Figure 3) can be selected from Ethernet, GSM or WiFi. MODBUS TCP/IP Slave Settings​ We explained TSB settings in the previous section. Here, TCP Socket, TCP Server should be selected in TSB block for Slave device setting and Port number should be entered. For MODBUS communication, we add MODBUS TCP Slave, MTS block to TSB Block (Figure 4). Figure 4: Add MODBUS TCP Slave Function Block The block connections for the slave settings of our device are shown in Figure 4. We define the slave ID identifier from inside the MTS function block (Figure 5). We can also observe the data traffic of the Slave side in Modbus Communication. For this, if we want to get the number of packets received, the number of faulty packets and the last packet status information, we can use it by connecting a flag or register to the Rx, Err, Sta outputs, respectively. Figure 5: Modbus TCP/IP Slave Settings (Exp: Slave address : 1) MODBUS TCP/IP Master Settings​ After making the relevant settings from the TSB settings (MODBUS TCP/IP Communication), we add the MODBUS TCP Master, MTM block to our TSB Block (Figure 6). If it is in the function block, you can see the Request Timeout and other settings. Figure 6: Modbus TCP/IP Master Connection We can send requests from our master device to Slave devices. These requests can be made by reading the values of the registers/registers defined by the MODBUS addresses (M:) in Slave devices or writing values to these registers. When a rising edge hits the trigger pin of the read/write blocks, the reader/writer command is sent to the Slave device and a response is expected. We can add MODBUS Reader or Printer blocks to our MTM block as shown in Figure 7. These blocks are shown as Word, Float and Long. MWR/MWWr, Word Reader/PRINTER 16-bit positive it is used for integer values. MFR/MFWR, Float Reader/Printer is used for 32-bit decimal values. MLO/MLWR is used for Long Readers/printers and 32-bit integers. Figure 7: Request Sending(Write/Read) of Modbus Master Device to Other Slave Devices, Communication Instead of reading and writing values from consecutive registers of the same data type in separate blocks, we can read and write tables with a single function block. It is recommended to use MODBUS Read/Write Table for this. The MODBUS Status block is recommended to check the connection status of a particular Slave device. When a negative word value is to be read, the MWR block is connected to the Long transaction block, and the transaction type is selected as “Word to Signed” and the negative values are read.MODBUS reader and writer blocks settings are shown in Figure 8 and Figure 9. Figure 8: Modbus Word Reader Figure 9: Modbus Word Writer Common values from Figure 8 and 9 are ID number, Register Address and Byte Sequence of the Slave device to be read/written. Function Code varies for register type and value. You can also see Other Settings in the pictures. Function Code values are 4 types according to the type of registers on the related Slave. Reading values are classified as follows. Function Code values are divided into 3 for the Write operation on the corresponding Slave. The classification of write values is as follows. Figure 10: Function Codes Description Byte Order varies by manufacturer. The correct order can be found in the device user's manual. If we want the values to be permanent or 0 value written when there is no connection, adding it to the log-kayıt memory, Dev-net synchronization or seeing it from the web interface, this section is in this section.

RS232 and RS485 serial port communication is used in MODBUS RTU communication. For the cable connections of RS232 and RS485 devices, refer to the product user manual. Serial port communication is defined in our program as follows. Figure 11: Serial Port Block and Settings Its settings for serial port communication are shown in Figure 11. Serial Port No selection is to define which port of our device is connected to. Serial Port No:0 for RS485 is 1 for RS232. Port type should be selected accordingly. Baudrate serial communication value can be selected from the list, or the Other option can be used for values that are not in the list. Databits, Parity and Stopbit data are also entered. In this way, Serial port settings are completed. In this section, MODBUS RTU Slave and MODBUS RTU Master device settings will be displayed respectively. MODBUS RTU Slave Settings​ The physical cable connections and port settings of our MODBUS RTU supported Slave device are shown in the Serial Port Block in the previous section (MODBUS RTU Communication). In this section, we will show the MODBUS RTU Slave settings of my device. We select MODBUS RTU Slave from the Door Types section in programming and connect it to the Serial Port Block. Figure 12: MODBUS RTU Slave Connection and Settings MRS; When MODBUS RTU Slave block is clicked, Modbus Slave Address definition section is displayed. In Picture 9, Modbus Slave Address is defined as 1. We can also define the Modbus Slave address of our slave device here. Using the Rx, Err, and Sta connections of the MODBUS RTU Slave block, we can see the received data packet count, the number of faulty packets and the status of the last packet data by connecting a flag or register. MODBUS RTU MASTER Settings​ MODBUS RTU Slave, MODBUS RTU Master device is required to receive or send data from the device. For this, the settings of our device, which will be defined as MODBUS RTU Master, are explained in this section. In programming, MODBUS RTU Master , connection of MRM block is as shown below. Figure 13: MODBUS RTU Master Connection and Settings Request Timeout, which is the data waiting time, can be set from Function Block settings, block name/Line definition. By connecting a register or flag to the Tx, Err and Sta outputs of the function block, the number of data packets sent, the number of faulty packets and the last packet status can be seen. A suitable MODBUS Word, Long, Float reader or writer block can be connected to the MRM output to read or write data from Slave devices with MODBUS RTU protocol. Instead of reading and writing values ​​from consecutive registers of the same data type in separate blocks, we can do table read-write with a single function block. For this, it is recommended to use the MODBUS Read/Write Table. MODBUS Status block is recommended to check the connection status of a particular Slave device. Figure 14: Connection of Modbus Read/Rrite Block to Modbus RTU Master Block MODBUS read and write blocks are also used in common with TCP and RTU. Sample Project: Read Analyzer with MODBUS RTU Protocol​ In order to be able to read the analyzer with the MODBUS RTU protocol, the analyzer must support the RS232 and RS485 connections, which are the connection types in our device. In order to provide Serial Communication from supporting devices, we need to know the required values. You can find the information in the user manual of the device to be connected. For example, we will read an analyzer with RS485 communication. For this, Port type RS485 and Port no:0 are selected. If we used RS232, Port type RS232 and Port no:1 should be selected. We enter the baudrate value of the analyzer from the Baudrate Selection section. If this value is not in the list, we can enter Other. When we enter the Veribits, parity and stop bit values ​​for the connection and click OK, our Seriport block settings are completed. We add Modbus RTU Master and Read write blocks. In read-write blocks, we use it to access values ​​that do not have read or write protection from the analyzer. Modbus RTU Id, Register Address, Function Code and Byte Order settings should be entered in this block. These settings can be learned from the Analyzer user manual or from the interface on it, if available. Updating the values ​​to be read/written occurs when a rising edge signal arrives at the Ttk pin on the Modbus Read/Write Blocks. It is recommended to use the Modbus Read/Write Table, as the values ​​of the same type of registers with multiple sequential addresses are read in value readings.

MODBUS Read/Write Table Block​ It is used in MODBUS TCP or RTU Master blocks. It is recommended to use this function block when reading data values ​​from registers of the same type with sequential addresses, to avoid duplication. The connection type is as shown below. Figure 16: Connection and Settings of MODBUS Read/Write Table Function Block Table settings are the same as Read and write settings. The advantage of Modbus Read/Write Table is that we can read or write values ​​to Sequential address registers with a single MODBUS Status Function Block​ Connects to MODBUS Master blocks. It is used when we want to get status information of slave devices. Connection type and settings are as shown below. Figure 17: Connection and Settings of MODBUS Status Function Block The MSta Mas entrance is the entrance to the Master block. Rtu is the Slave ID entry from which we want to receive status information. It can be defined by adding a register to this part or from the settings section. MODBUS Gateway Function Block​ MODBUS Gateway devices are basically used to create a gateway for master units in MODBUS TCP network to access slave units in MODBUS RTU network. Request packets coming over MODBUS TCP are converted into MODBUS RTU packets and sent to the RTU network. It also receives the response from the RTU network and sends it to the MODBUS TCP network. On the MODBUS TCP side, the number of TRANSACTION in requests and responses must be the same, and it is also the duty of the GATEWAY device to provide this. Mikrodev Control devices can be programmed to work simultaneously as GATEWAY among the protocols they support. One of the blocks that provides this is the MODBUS GATEWAY block. MODBUS GATEWAY block can serve in 2 directions listed below: 1- MODBUS TCP Master device to MODBUS RTU Slave device 2- MODBUS RTU Master device to MODBUS TCP Slave device Master in block usage and Slave blocks are enough to start working as GATEWAY. In case of a request for a different ID than the Modbus ID on the slave block side, the relevant request will be read through the master block. Note that Modbus RTU Slave ID and Modbus TCP/IP Slave ID are not the same.

The components that make up SNMP are; • Agent application: The name given to the application that runs the SNMP service on the device and saves the necessary information and transfers it to the administrator unit or applies the change from the administrator unit to the device. • Admin application: The application that receives the information needed from the agent application and displays it to the user and sends the values that the user wants to change to the device. • Network Management System (NMS): It is the name given to the application that runs in the administrative unit and provides monitoring and management of all devices connected to a network. Mikrodev products work as SNMP Agent application. SNMP Management Information Units (MIBs): MIBs are collections of information stored in a hierarchical structure. To reach the value of a particular variable in SNMP, the relevant unit of this universally determined collection is used.

In such cases, when the data read from the field is contaminated because of device replacement, project update, and etc.; trends and counter total values may also get contaminated. To prevent this, a mechanism on SCADA can be configured in the following way. We need 3 seperate tags to solve the problem. As an example we will create a \"CounterTag\" tag. In parallel we will create a \"CounterTag_latest\" tag under \"Database Channel\" and a \"CounterTag_controller\" tag under Macro channel to fix field-based distortions so that this tag can read the latest value logged in the database.  We will use the following query in the tag settings to get the most recent value we have logged into the \"CounterTag_latest\" tag: select dataval from logs.lct_table where tag_id=2  This query will read the last logged value of the \"CounterTag\" tag with tag ID \"2\" Finally, we will add the control macro to the \"CounterTag_controller\" tag. The macro will be:  [v1=$4e0] [IF,v1,3] [$4=$6+0] [E] [v0=$4>$2] [IF,v0,3] [$2=$4+0] [E] [$4=$2+0] [E]  This macro consists of 3 main sections: Lines numbered as \"1\"; reads the last logged value from the database when the server is running for the first time.

At the same time, project files must be present on the server computers and they must be up to date (same as each other). To ensure this synchronization, a version control tool such as SVN can be used or the files can be moved manually. In order for the backup and main server to communicate, the main server must have port 51313 open on the computer. Make sure that this port is allowed in the firewall settings. In the next step, the following configuration settings must be made in the ScadaServer.ini files on the primary server (PRIMARY) and the backup server (BACKUP): Primary server(PRIMARY): [REDUNDANCY] ServerMode=PRIMARY PrimaryIP=192.168.2.201 PrimaryPORT=51314 Timeout=60 size=0  Backup server(BACKUP): [REDUNDANCY] ServerMode=BACKUP PrimaryIP=192.168.2.201 PrimaryPORT=51314 Timeout=60 size=0  ServerMode: Specifies the backup operation mode. This value can be PRIMARY or BACKUP. When this mode is set to BACKUP, the server communicates with the PRIMARY server to create a redundant structure. PrimaryIP: The PRIMARY server IP address to which the server in BACKUP mode will connect is written in this field. PrimaryPORT: The port number of the PRIMARY server to which the server in BACKUP mode will connect is written in this field. Timeout: Is the value in seconds that specifies the time PRIMARY server is out of service before the BACKUP server become active. In the example, the IP address of the primary server (PRIMARY) is a fixed IP of \"192.168.2.201\". The IP address of the primary server in the system to be installed must be a static IP in this way, variable IP from a DHCP server should not be used. The port number set in PrimaryPORT can be set differently according to security requirements. In this case, the correct port number should be entered by modifying every 2 configuration files. After the configuration process is completed, first the primary and then the backup servers are started . From this moment on, the backup server will switch on and off in case of a shutdown, watching the primary server. When the primary server becomes active again, the backup server will stop itself by switching to the watching mode.

Therefore, if these files are not synchronized with the files on the main server, an older version of the project will be sent to the clients. A synchronization mechanism must be established to prevent this from happening. Assuming that the project files are on the SVN version control server as described earlier, you can provide automatic synchronization as follows We create a batch script that will trigger SVN synchronization. In this example, the file name is updateSvn.bat. Modify the contents of the file according to the file paths in your system to make it like this: CD D:\\MIKRODEV\\Projects\\DepoProject \"C:\\Program Files\\TortoiseSVN\\bin\\svn.exe\" update  Every time we run this script, it will synchronize the project folder with that of the SVN server. In the next step, this script will be configured to run at specific intervals. For this we will use the Windows \"Schedule Tasks\" tool. By following the steps below, the synchronization procedure will be run every 10 minutes. You can configure this time interval as you like. Task Scheduler Create a new task Timing Programming Set timing settings. In this example we choose to work once every 10 minutes. Script Selection Finally, associate the .bat file you created with the timer. If you confirm the timer, the backup server will synchronize itself every 10 minutes with the project on the main server. In case of failure, downtime or excessive traffic at the primary server, a redundant server can be implemented to take the primary server's place. When backup server is selected in redundancy mode, primary server IP and redundant server activation timeout are entered.

Logging​ Log to Database​ If this option is not enabled, the tag value will not be logged on the system and historical values will not be visible. Also, historical values can not be viewed on the graph. Log on change​ Logging is done in case of tag value change. The type of change can be of the type \"Percentage\" or \"Level\" change. Percentage Change​ If \"Percentage Change\" is selected as the type of change; Logging is done if the tag value changes by the specified percentage value of the latest logged value. If value is set to \"0\", all kinds of changes are logged. Level Change​ If \"Level Change\" is selected as the type of change; if the tag value has changed by the specified value, logging is done. If value is set to \"0\", all kinds of changes are logged. Log Periodically​ If this option is enabled, the tag is continuously logged in the specified time period. Note: Logging type and tags to be logged must be carefully selected to avoid unnecessary increase in the size of the data to be stored. For example; The tags should never be logged if you do not need historical values. If a level or percentage change is selected for analog variables, a percentage or level appropriate to the data exchange pattern should be selected. For digital values, \"log on change\" should be used instead of periodic logging. Data Logging Filter​ By using the data logging filter, you can prevent the measurement values ??collected from the field from being logged according to the filter you selected. So, you will be able to pick up possible false data Only log when decreasing by maximum This filter only allows logging of descending data below the entered maximum value. For example; If the maximum value is entered as 1000: 188, 225 ,(logged) 1500,(not logged) 350 ,(logged) 400 (logged)  In this example, the value '1500' is 1275 more than the previous value, so it exceeds the maximum value of 1000. Thus, is not logged. Only log when increasing by maximum This filter only allows logging of incremental data below the maximum value entered. Only log if value is in range This filter allows logging only if the value read from the field is in the specified range. Only log if value is out of range This filter allows logging only if the value read from the field is out of the specified range.

To run the server independently of the editor, a folder is specified by selecting \"Editor > Tools > Create Server Files\" and the server files are copied to this folder. The \"ServerEngine\" widget is used to start the server. By default, the \"ServerEngine\" widget searches for a folder named \"Project\" in the same folder as itself. The “Project” folder contains special files created by the editor. The main ones are; “MikrodevScada.ini” is “Project.zip”, “project pages with .sca extension” and component files. The server reads the information such as which database to connect to and where to keep the records in the “MikrodevScada.ini” file. When the SCADA server is started for the first time, the user may be prompted to enter database connection information. The server can also open a project in a different folder using the following command line parameters. “ServerEngine –dir “C:\\Users\\yg\\Desktop\\server\\projectname“ ” -dir : Proje klasörü Server Main Page On the main screen of the server, there is a console where general system logs can be viewed. Important changes related to the server are shown on this console. More detailed server logs are saved in a separate file. When the “Start” button is pressed, the server establishes a connection with the field devices. After the connection is established, the server opens a port that clients can connect to and waits for incoming connections.
