A secret password is set in the PSK Secret section. The Time interval, timeout values, and Action sections should be filled in.

After configuring the phase1 and phase2 settings with the same values for both devices and clicking the "Apply" button, a tunnel will be established between the defined local networks.

<center>

![webserver40](/img/webserver40.png)
***<center>Figure 37: IPSEC Configuration Page</center>***

</center>

Active IPsec connections can be viewed in the "Connections" tab.


### Network

#### Firewall Page

Firewall settings can be configured on the device via the web server to enhance network security. Access IPs and ports for the device can be determined by adding filter rules.
Only the Administrator user can access this page.

<center>

![webserver41](/img/webserver41.png)
***<center>Figure 38: Firewall Page</center>***

</center>

To add a new filter rule, click on "Add Firewall Rule". Continue with the "Add" option from the warning screen. Select the protocol type for which you want to add a connection filter to the device from the Protocol section. Enter the IP and port information you want to filter in the Source ip and port section, and enter the DM50 IP address in the destination ip section. From the Action section, select whether access to the device will be allowed or denied via the filtered IP or port information.

Fill in the necessary fields according to the filtering rule you want to create and click on "Apply" at the bottom of the page. There are three different modes for the firewall.

##### Input Mode

<center>

![webserver95](/img/webserver95.png)
***<center>Figure 39: Firewall Input Rule</center>***

</center>

A firewall input rule is a security rule that controls traffic directly coming to the firewall itself. These rules determine whether requests from specific IP addresses, protocols, or ports will be accepted or rejected. In this example, access to port 510 of the 192.168.10.58 device is only allowed from the IP address 192.168.10.151, and connections from all other IP addresses are blocked.

To verify that the connection is working correctly, a connection should first be established from the IP address 192.168.10.151 to the port 510 of 192.168.10.58. This connection is expected to be successful. Then, the same connection should be attempted from a different IP address. In this case, the connection should fail. This example enhances security by ensuring that only authorized devices can access the specified port, while blocking all other access attempts.

In this configuration, a Modbus TCP/IP connection is established over port 510 of the device with IP address 192.168.10.151. By connecting to the 192.168.10.58 device via SSH, it has been verified with telnet that the 192.168.10.151:510 connection was successful.

<center>

![webserver43](/img/webserver43.png)

</center>

<center>

![webserver44](/img/webserver44.png)
***<center>Figure 40: Network Connection and Access Control</center>***

</center>

##### Output Mode

<center>

![webserver96](/img/webserver96.png)
***<center>Figure 41: Firewall Output Rule</center>***

</center>

A firewall output rule is a security rule that controls traffic going out from the system. These rules are used to restrict or allow outgoing connections to specific IP addresses, protocols, or ports. In this example, security rules have been applied to traffic going from the IP address 192.168.10.151 to port 540 of 192.168.10.58. The ACCEPT rule allows outgoing traffic from 192.168.10.151, while the DROP rule blocks outgoing traffic from all other IPs to the same destination.

For the connection to be successful, a connection must be established from 192.168.10.151 to 192.168.10.58:540, and it should fail when attempted from a different IP. Additionally, port 540 of the target device must be open, and there should be no restrictions in the INPUT rules.

##### Forward Rule

<center>

![webserver47](/img/webserver47.png)
***<center>Figure 42: Firewall Forward Connection Page</center>***

</center>

The Firewall Forward Chain is used to control traffic passing through a specific device. In the example described here, TCP traffic routed from the IP address 192.168.10.151 to the IP address 192.168.10.156 over port 520 is allowed, while traffic from all other sources is rejected.

To verify the connection, a connection should be established from the IP address 192.168.10.151 to the IP address 192.168.10.156 with the command telnet 192.168.10.156 520. The connection is expected to be successful, while the connection should fail when the same operation is attempted from a different IP address.

This configuration enhances security by ensuring that only authorized devices can access the specified port.

</center>

<center>

![webserver49](/img/webserver49.png)
***<center>Figure 43: Network Connection and Access Control</center>***

</center>

#### NAT Page

NAT operation is performed from this page via the web server interface. NAT (Network Address Translation) is a method that allows multiple devices on the same network to access the internet using the same public IP.

Only the Administrator user can access this page.

<center>

![webserver50](/img/webserver50.png)
***<center>Figure 44: NAT Page</center>***

</center>

For a new NAT configuration, the host gateway is first set as the router's IP. Then, click on "Add NAT Rule" from the NAT page. Continue with the "Add Rule" option from the information screen. Whether the WAN IP information is obtained statically or automatically is set via the action option. Select the SNAT option to set it statically or the Masquerade option to obtain it automatically. After selecting this setting, enter the host IP information in the Source Address section and the WAN IP information in the To Destination section. Enter the port information through which the host should access the WAN in the Port section.

Fill in the necessary fields according to the NAT configuration you want to create and click on "Save and Apply" at the bottom of the page. Once this process is complete, the host connected to the router will be accessible from the WAN via the specified port. Active NAT configurations can be viewed in the "Connections" tab.

##### SNAT

SNAT (Source NAT) is a NAT method that changes the source IP address of outgoing network traffic. It is generally used to allow devices on an internal network to access the internet through a specific external IP address. It is used to manage access from the internal network to the external network, enhance security, and hide network addresses.

For example, the internet traffic of a device with the IP address 192.168.1.10 can be routed through an external IP address such as 5.26.182.3 using SNAT to access the internet.

<center>

![webserver89](/img/webserver89.png)
***<center>Figure 45: Network Configuration of the Device to be Connected to the Internet</center>***

</center>

In the network configuration, communication was established using the gateway address 192.168.10.58 of the device. With the SNAT rule, traffic originating from the IP address 192.168.10.156 was routed to the address 81.6.111.229, and it was verified that the device successfully accessed the internet. This configuration allows a device that cannot directly access the internet to communicate by being routed through NAT.

##### DNAT

DNAT (Destination NAT) is a NAT method that changes the destination IP address of incoming network traffic. It is generally used to route incoming requests from the external network to a specific server on the internal network. It is used for purposes such as port forwarding, providing external access to web and application servers, and load balancing.

For example, requests coming to the external IP on port 8080 can be routed to 192.168.1.10:80 on the internal network, allowing external clients to access the internal server.

For the DM50 device to access the internet using a PPP connection, the Gateway address must be defined as 192.168.10.58. When a connection is established using port 502 via Telediagram, traffic should be routed to the DM110 (192.168.10.156) device with a DNAT rule. Thanks to this configuration, requests coming from the external network are routed to DM110 via DNAT, establishing a connection.

<center>

![webserver56](/img/webserver56.png)
***<center>Figure 49: Add Bridge Rule Page</center>***

</center>

Active Bridge rules can be viewed in the "Connections" tab.

#### Port Forwarding Page

The web server allows port forwarding for devices connected to the router. This feature is achieved by redirecting requests arriving at a specific port number to a specific internal IP address and port.
Only the Administrator user can access this page.

<center>

![webserver57](/img/webserver57.png)
***<center>Figure 50: Port Forwarding Page</center>***

</center>

To add a new port forwarding configuration, click on "Add Port Forward". Continue with the "Add Rule" option in the information screen.

Active port forwarding configurations can be viewed in the "Connections" tab.

In the example described here, external network traffic arriving at port 4124 is redirected to port 502 of the device with the IP address 192.168.10.58. While connections coming from the external network are routed using port 4124, the 192.168.10.58 device on the internal network is made ready for connection via port 502. This configuration allows requests from the external network to be redirected to a specific device on the internal network.
