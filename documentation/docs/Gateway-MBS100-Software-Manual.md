## MODBUS Gateway Configuration Software

[MBS100 Software Manual](https://www.mikrodev.com/en/docs/ModbusGateway/software_manual/MIKRODEV_SM_MBS100_CG_EN.pdf)

### General Information

The Assistant software is used to make all necessary settings for the Mikrodev Gateway
devices. Thanks to the software, device settings can be made online and/or offline. The
settings that are loaded on the device can easily be downloaded and the previously saved
settings can easilly be uploaded into the device by the program.
The connection between the program and the device can be established in various ways
such as USB, Ethernet, GSM, Wi-Fi. For Ethernet supported devices; there is also the ability
to search the network and list details with connection information.

### Device Connection

#### USB Serial Connection

One of the methods for establishing communication between PC and Mikrodev device in
device configuration is USB serial connection. In order to perform USB connection
between PC and device, you need to install USB driver for PCs with Windows 7/8 / 8.1
operating systems. There is no need to install the USB driver for Windows 10 operating
systems. For serial connection over USB, “Connect over USB" box in the Connect and
Configure Your Device section of the Assistant software is selected. In the USB Port
Selection section, you should select the port and click "Connect". USB connection will be
established after that.

#### TCP Connection – Device Discovery Mode

"Network Discovery" option is used to detect and connect IP addresses of Mikrodev
devices which are active in the local network. The "Network Discovery " box will be
highlighted after the "Connect via TCP" box is checked in the Connect and Configure to
Device section of the Assistant software. After clicking "Scan Network for Mikrodev
Devices", the serial number, IP address, listening port and software versions of all Mikrodev devices which are active in the network are listed on the screen. You
can connect the device on the list by double clicking on the device name on the screen.

#### TCP Connection – Manual

When manually entering the ip address and port number of the device that is active in
the local network, "Manual" option is used. The "Manual" box is checked after the
"Connect over TCP" checkbox is checked in the Connect and Configure Device section
from the Assistant software. The IP address of the device to be connected is entered into
the "Device IP" section, the port number is entered into the "Port" section and "Connect"
is clicked. Assistant software connects to the Mikrodev device with specified ip
address and port number.

</center>

Check the pcb version number placed to last 3 character of response like “pXX”


VERSION=MBS100_E_s15.52p66

•	If pcb version is p55 ; 

o	Port 1 -> RS 232 (ROUTE 1)
o	Port 2 -> RS 485 (ROUTE 2)

•	If pcb version is p66 ;

o	Port 1 -> RS 485 (ROUTE 1)
o	Port 2 -> RS 232 (ROUTE 2)


### Offline Settings

Offline mode is used when parameter settings are made and saved without connecting to
the device. Click on "Click here for offline configuration" on the Assistant main screen
when you want to make the offline parameter settings. The device is selected in the
