If you want to write a value from the device specific command window, the command "AT + SPECIALTYPE = WRITE KOMUT" is defined and the value written when the "send" button is clicked is displayed in the console window.

If the write operation is successful, the command "SPECIALTY = OK" is printed in the console window.

### List of The AT Command

Some of the AT commands used in Mikrodev products are only readable and some have both readable and writeble capabilities.

The commands on the AT command list differ according to the devices.

The AT commands used in GSM, Ethernet, Wi-Fi enabled products are indicated in the headers (E / G / W).

* AT+FBD

In Mikrodiagram, it is used to read block value and write block value by using "block numbers" of door types.

If the value is to be written, "AT + FBD = BLOKNO, VALUE" is defined and clicked on the "write" command.

If the block value is to be read, "AT + FBD = BLOKNO,?" is defined and clicked on the "write" command.

The "read" command is not used in the AT + FBD command, only the "write" command is used.

<center>

![mikroterminal-interface-28](/img/mikroterminal-interface-28.png)

</center>

* AT+FORMATFS

AT + FORMATFS = 1 command is used to format Mikrodev products. When the AT + FORMATFS = 1 command is sent to the device, the firmware will be deleted, so it is necessary to load the firmware again to program the device.

* AT+CANTIMEOUT

<center>

![mikroterminal-interface-29](/img/mikroterminal-interface-29.png)

</center>

AT + CANTIMEOUT command Mikrodev is used to protect the position of the inputs and outputs on the expansion units for a specified period of time in case of communication failure between CPU modules and expansion units.

The CANTIMEOUT time runs in millisecond (ms) time scale.

When the communication link between the input modules and the CPU breaks, inputs up to the number of CANTIMEOUT entered into the CPU do not change position in the software.

When the communication link between the output modules and the CPU breaks, the outputs do not change positions as long as the CANTIMEOUT times entered in the output modules.

The CANTIMEOUT time input to the CPU is used for the input modules, the CANTIMEOUT time input to the output modules for the output modules is used.

For example, if AT + CANTIMEOUT = 60000 (ms) is defined for the CPU and expansion units, the incoming digital input signal position is maintained through the expansion unit until 60000 (ms) (1 minute) after communication between the digital input (DI) expansion unit and the CPU is interrupted. 60000 ms. After the CANTIMEOUT time has elapsed, the digital inputs are pulled to logic (0) if no connection to the expansion unit is still present.

* AT+GPRSIP(G)

The data package (internet package) is the IP of the SIM card. Supplied by the GSM operator.

It can only be read by AT + GPRSIP command. Changed.

If the device is to be used as a server, a SIM card with a fixed IP address must be provided.

  When a SIM card with a fixed IP is provided, APN information must also be received from the GSM operator

* AT+GPRSAPN(G)

AT + GPRSAPN command is used to define APN for Mikrodev products with GSM TCP communication feature.

Since the APN that needs to be defined varies according to the SIM card operator used in the device,it must be supplied from the customer service of the relevant GSM operator.

The APN has to be defined if the used device is to be used as a server in the TCP communication with the GSM line (if the device will connect to another IP).

Note: The SIM card used in the APN-defined device must have a static IP

* AT+CSQ(G)

It is the value of the GSM signal quality (the power of the GSM line) that the devices with GSM capability are installed. It can be between -1 and 31.

Even if the SIM card is not inserted, the value can be read while the GSM antenna is connected. (Emergency calls are used on mobile phones when the SIM card is not inserted.)

AT + CSQ is only readable command.

The pull chart is as follows.

*  AT+SIM(G)

It is used for SIM card inquiry in Mikrodev products with GSM hardware.

With "AT + SIM =?" read only command. The value can not be written.

If the answer to the command is SIM = 1, it indicates that the SIM card is correctly installed and is fault-free.

The response to the command is SIM = 0 to indicate that the SIM card is not inserted, is incorrectly installed or is defective.

* AT+WIFISSID(W)

It is used to identify the WI-FI network name to be included in WI-FI enabled products.

In the "AT + WIFISSID" command window, the WI-FI name is written, the "write" command is clicked,

When you want to read the current WI-FI SSID, click "AT + WIFISSID" "read" command.

* AT+WIFIPSSW(W)

It is used to describe the password of the WI-FI network to be included in WI-FI-enabled products.

AT + WIFIPSSW WI-FI password is written into the command window, click on the "write" command,

When the current WI-FI password is desired to be read, the AT + WIFIPSSW "read" command is clicked.

*  AT+TEMPTYPE

For products with RTD temperature sensor input, temperature sensor selection is made.

Hardware must be manufactured in accordance with the temperature sensor of the product.

The PT100 temperature sensor can be used if AT + TEMPTYPE = 0.

The NTC temperature sensor can be used if AT + TEMPTYPE = 1.

The PT1000 temperature sensor can be used if AT + TEMPTYPE = 2.

* AT+PRODUCTNO

Hardware product code inquiry for the products in Mikrodev product family is made.

The code that starts with the letter "p" (p42, p46, etc.) in the product embedded software (MP201_E_s11.09p42) must match the AT + PRODUCTNO code.

  AT + PRODUCTNO is the only readable command.

* AT+PTO

It is used to activate the "pulse train output" and "axis control" blocks.

AT + PTO = 1 command is activated. AT + PTO = 0 disable the command.

For current status inquiry, "AT + PTO =?" Command can be sent.

* AT+SOCKET

It is used to monitor the active connections of TCP socket blocks in Mikrodiagram project.

When AT + SOCKET = <"TCP Socket Block" Block Number> command is sent to the device, the connections made from the relevant TCP socket block are displayed.

Those with status "1" indicate that the connection exists. The "status" states, which are different from "1", indicate that the link already existed, but that the link broke down before the specified time.
