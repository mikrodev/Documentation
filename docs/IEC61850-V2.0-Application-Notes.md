When these steps are completed, the necessary configuration for communication between the relay and the RTU is finalized. This step is critical because it establishes the signal mapping required for successful data exchange.

Finally, the RTU project created in Telediagram is uploaded to the device, making the system ready for operation. Ensuring a successful upload is important to avoid configuration mismatches.

After completing the configuration using MDV61850 Browser and Telediagram, the following steps are applied to test whether communication between the RTU and the relay is successful:

*   Connect to the RTU device via Telediagram and open online monitoring. This allows real-time observation of data exchange.        
*   To start communication between the RTU and the relay, set the ConnectEnb block to 1. This enables the communication link. Monitor the Dev Status block to check the communication status between the RTU and the delay. If the Dev Status block shows the value 2, communication has been successfully established. Any other value might indicate a configuration issue or connection failure.              
*   When the Report Enable tag is set to 1, the Report Status and Data Set From Report blocks should receive the value 6. This confirms that the report mechanism is functioning properly.
*   In the RxTime Signal, the dataset value's read time should be displayed in epoch time. This ensures that timestamps are correctly processed. The Result Signal should display the current value of the dataset. Any discrepancies in the expected values might indicate issues in data mapping or communication delays.
