title: ViewPLUS SCADA Client

## Client Operator Screen

To connect to the SCADA server, you need to enter the user, password, server address and port information into the client software. You need to use "User Manager" to create a new user. When this information is entered correctly, an encrypted connection is established between the server and the client software, and the project main screen sent from the server is displayed on the client.

Content shown on the client may differ depending on the access privileges of the user, the pages and the defined tags. Pages that do not corresponds with the access rights of the user will not be shown in the "page selector", or links that are directed to those pages will not work. If a visual element on the page contains a tag that the user does not have access to, the user is prevented from watching or controlling this item.

ViewPLUS Client is used to connect to an open ViewPLUS SCADA server. Visual operations developed on the editor screen can be viewed on the ViewPLUS Client screen.
